**Creative Image-Captions Recommender and Sentiment Extraction for personalization in marketing**

**Abstract**: This paper lies at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and Sentiment Analysis. It proposes a novel solution to one of the most challenging problems of marketing – understanding dynamic nature of consumer psychology -through an added feature on social media. Based on the picture posted or shared, user is given a set of creative caption choices as recommendations and based on the selection made – user sentiment can be extracted to market a product in more user-relevant, interesting and personalized manner. Due to information overload and intensified digital activity among consumers, deeper level of personalization is needed that can target customers not as part of presumed segments rather on individual levels. Providing engaging captions recommendation and then deriving the consumer sentiment behind a picture has strong potential in optimizing sequential marketing touch points leading to stronger consumer attraction and conversion.
